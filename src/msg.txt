Welcome to Esther's Escape Time Fractals Explorer! ʕ•́ᴥ•̀ʔっ♡
Type as an argument the first letter of the fractal you want to see:

1. mandelbrot
2. julia
3. burning ship

For the Julia set, you can additionally type the complex number as two seperate arguments.
Or you can use the mouse to click around the plane.
Press m/j/b to change the fractal on the screen.
